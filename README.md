# pgxtended
A library wrapper for pygame, to make it easier to use out of the box and let you focus on the coding instead of the logistics.
Functionality covered is mostly in the form of things like 'cameras' and prebuilt object base classes, which is most of the annoying part of pygame, just predone.
Best way to use this library is to just download the repo for your own use. Look at the source code, change it if needed, look at if confused.
